# Coffee_Analysis
I like coffee. Further, I like hot coffee. What I don't like is my coffee cooling quicker than needed, so, naturally, I wrote a Python script to put my intuition about the time it takes coffee to cool when just sitting there on a rigorous foundation.

The crux of this analysis is to understand the effects of preheating my coffee mug before pouring the coffee. Newton's Law of Cooling was used in as rigorous a method as possible. Ideally, I would use the heat equation to more accurately model the system, but that will be left for someone who can code better than me. 

Assumptions:
1) Heat is uniformly distributed throughout the mug
2) Mug is comprised of uniform ceramic
3) Coffee temperature in the pot is 180 deg F
4) Boundary interactions produced negligible temperature difference

I used my home references and good old Google to search for and validate material properties and constants. Because I like creamer in my coffee, I included some analysis regarding the cooling effect of creamer taken at 38 deg F

Note that this whole analytical rabbit hole started because my wife did not trust me when I said a preheated cup would make a difference. To validate the models, I took a stopwatch (yes, those still exist as a standalone piece of gear) and performed the experiment for empirical data. Thankfully, because I would not have heard the end of it had it not worked (though, I mean, come on...Newton's Law of Cooling, right?), the measurements matched the model.

As always, let me know where I can improve!
